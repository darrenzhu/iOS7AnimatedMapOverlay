iOS7AnimatedMapOverlay
======================

A sample project for adding animated overlays at points on the map. 

iOS7 makes it impossible to add subviews to MKOverlays. This projects is an example of a workaround to allow animated overlays to be added to MKAnnotations. 

Adapted from the example below and made to work for iOS7.
